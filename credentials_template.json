If it is the weekend, please note that I like to eat lunch from 1pm-1:30pm.\n3. If it is a workday, please note that I will be busy from 9:20am - 5pm doing work.\n4. I would like to eat dinner from 6:30pm-7:30pm. Please block off this time.\n6. From 10:00pm-8am I am resting. Do not scheduling during this time period."
